The steps to build a private blockchain
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Install the ethereum in each node (install.sh)
2. All node must have identifical Genesis file (e.g.CommonGenesis.json) (init.sh)
3. The static node id should be given to each node to build the network. (GenerateStaticNode.sh)
4. Move the static-nodes.json to each node in the folder /home/luxbch/data
5. Each node should run for mining for a while.
6. Each node should see the root static node. (net.peercount)
7. On each node run  (console.sh)
7. We need to run some node in mining mode to serve the blockchain (mining.sh)

*****Make sure that nodes can talk to each other ex. using ping ipadress ******
